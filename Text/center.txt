<p><b>GWALIOR FORT</b><br>
The Gwalior Fort commonly known as the Gwāliiyar Qila, is a hill fort near Gwalior, Madhya Pradesh, India. The fort has existed at least since the 10th century, and the inscriptions 
and monuments found within what is now the fort campus indicate that it may have existed as early as the beginning of the 6th century. The modern-day fort, embodying a defensive structure 
and two palaces was built by the Tomar Rajput[2] ruler Man Singh Tomar.The fort has been administered by a number of different rulers in its history.
The present-day fort consists of a defensive structure and two main palaces, "Man Mandir" and Gujari Mahal, built by Tomar Rajput ruler Man Singh Tomar (reigned 1486–1516 CE), the latter 
one for his wife, Queen Mrignayani.[1] The second oldest record of "zero" in the world was found in a small temple (the stone inscription has the second oldest record of the numeric zero
symbol having a place value as in the modern decimal notation), which is located on the way to the top. The inscription is around 1500 years old.

<p><b>Bandhavgarh National Park: </b>
Bandhavgarh has a history of being the abode of white tigers. All the sightings have been recorded only here. Although no white tigers have been reported from the wild in the last 50 years, 
as many as 8 sightings were recorded in the first half of the 20th century.In 1951, Maharaja Martand Singh of Rewa captured an orphaned white tiger cub in Bandhavgarh. He domesticated this 
male white tiger and named him Mohan. The Maharaja was also able to successfully breed white tigers in Rewa and export the cubs to other countries. As a result, all white tigers in captivity
today are Mohan's descendants. The species has thrived in captivity, with a number of specimens related to Mohan finding homes in zoos and circuses all over the world. 
'Mohan' has been kept for display, stuffed and mounted, at the Baghel Museum. Mohan was the last white tiger spotted in the wild.

The Marble Rocks is an area along the Narmada river in central India near the city of Jabalpur; in Bhedaghat of Jabalpur District, in the state of Madhya Pradesh. The river has carved the soft 
marble, creating a beautiful gorge of about 8 km in length. It is a popular Indian tourist destination. The local marble is mined and carved into various figures and transported all over India.
The Marble Rocks are a gorge along part of the Narmada River’s 1,077 km (669.2 mi) path through Madhya Pradesh.[1] Earlier, the gorge was narrow in size and hence, monkeys could cross over from 
one side to another. This gave the gorge its local name- Bandar Kudni (meaning monkeys' jumping place). The white marbles are predominantly rich in magnesium and are closer in hardness to soapstone. 
This softness allows them to be carved. The area also contains blue and brown coloured marble
