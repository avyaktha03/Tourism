<p><b>JAGAT SHIROMANI TEMPLE</b><br><br>
The Jagat Shiromani Temple is a Hindu temple located in Amer, Jaipur. Possessing an extraordinary architecture which enchants 
with its greatness and beauty, it is a site of immense fascination for the tourists. The temple is devoted to Hindu gods Lord Krishna and Lord Vishnu, 
and is said to be built around 1599-1608 AD by Queen Kanakwati, the wife of King Man Singh I, in the memory of their son Jagat Singh. ‘Jagat Shiromani’, 
meaning ‘Head Jewel of Lord Vishnu’, is an epochal facet of the ancient history of Rajasthan. The temple houses the idols of Lord Krishna, Lord Vishnu and Meera Bai.
The Temple's architecture is quite interesting – it is a riveting amalgamation of various architectural styles including Jain, Hindu, Mughal and South Indian. 
Carved out of white marble and black stone, the walls and ceilings of the temple are covered in exquisite bas relief carvings of elephants, horses, Purans and other legends. 
The most prodigious feature of the temple is the marble Torans (pylon) or ornamental arches at the entrance, carved out of a single piece of marble.
